What inspiration can we take from games to create sticky, fun learning experiences? 🤔

I don’t have concrete ideas right now, but I _am_ starting to dig for answers. In the next few weeks and months, I hope to turn this seed of an idea into a solid, reliable tree.

## What I’ve learnt so far 🔬

There seem to be a lot of misconceptions around the term “gamification” and what it stands for.

Most people associate “gamification” with progress bars, points, badges, and leaderboards. But games are a lot more than that. They’re complex systems involving human psychology and motivation, competition and cooperation, narratives and stories, decisions and consequences, and yes, progress, achievements, and rewards. 🏅

This may feel overwhelming to think about, but the truth—and the good news—is that to create a gamified learning experience, you don’t need to build complex game systems.

Your students would hate that. 😬

At its heart, gamification is about strategically incorporating game elements and mechanics into non-game experiences. The keyword here is “strategic.” A misplaced leaderboard or meaningless badge does not improve the experience for anyone. In fact, they become distractions from the core experience.

## How to gamify your online course 👾

I don’t have anything solid yet, but there _is_ something I want you to think about…

When you play a new video game, do you breeze through every challenge it throws at you?

Probably not. 🤷🏻‍♂️

You play, you fail, you think about what you did wrong, and you try again. You do that over and over again until you win. Then comes the next challenge. Rinse and repeat.

You learn through practice and feedback.

When building your course, be very intentional about practice opportunities, the feedback loop, and the difficulty of challenges you put in front of your students at each step in their learning journey. 👣

It might not feel like you’re “gamifying” anything, but that’s not the point. The point is to take _inspiration_ from games, to design a learning experience that students enjoy and learn from. Focus on that.

## What do you think?
