What do the best movies, the best sports, and the best games all have in common? In particular, what makes them so good at grabbing our attention and keeping us in our toes?

In his book, Theory of Fun, Raph Koster describes learning as the "drug" that hooks us into games. But, when a game becomes too easy, too hard, too slow, too fast, or too limiting, it becomes boring. The same could be said for movies or any other experience that we typically enjoy.

What can we learn from game design, that we can apply to teaching online, to make courses more engaging and interesting?

There are a lot of misconceptions around what gamification is. Most people think it has to do with points, badges, and leaderboards, while in reality, those things are only the most _visible_ elements of a gamified experience. A leaderboard without real competition is meaningless, as are points and rewards without a sense of accomplishment. Yet, there are [invisible elements](https://www.notion.so/The-higher-purpose-of-your-course-ffdca32178da4b88ae7f8e9cc25017c4) in a game that can be far more powerful, and we rarely notice them.

[Yu-kai Chou](https://yukaichou.com/)—author of Actionable Gamification—created the Octalysis framework, presenting 8 core drives that intrinsically, and extrinsically, motivate us as humans. That’s how games are made fun to play, and I believe we can do the same for learning.

The best part? Good gamification doesn’t have to be complex. It just has to be done right.
