The best games, the best movies, and the best sports are all thrilling experiences. The thrill and excitement is what attracts us to them.

I believe learning can be thrilling too. How? Gamification.

There are a lot of misconceptions around what gamification is. Most people think it has to do with points, badges, and leaderboards, while in reality, those things are only the most visible elements of a gamified experience. A leaderboard without real competition is meaningless, as are points and rewards without a sense of accomplishment. Yet, there are invisible elements in a game that can be far more powerful, and we rarely notice them.

Yu-kai Chou—author of Actionable Gamification—created the Octalysis framework, presenting 8 core drives that intrinsically, and extrinsically, motivate us as humans. That’s how games are made fun to play, and I believe we can do the same for learning.

The best part? Good gamification doesn’t have to be complex. It just has to be done right.

What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear "gamification"? 💭

For Hauke, it was ["Visualized progress and numbers."](https://twitter.com/prahlhauke/status/1442203778074173445) Yet, even without visual progress indicators, he'd play his favorite game "because of its story."

For Val, it was ["Scam"](https://twitter.com/valsopi/status/1442209894262792201) because "it incentivizes for something you might not do naturally." As it turns out, he used gamification to scam his own kids and trick them into eating food they didn't want… with airplane spoons! 😅

Here's a list of stuff

- Go to A
- Go to B
- Go nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere

Like any technique leveraging human psychology, gamification can be used for good, as well as for evil.

> "Slot machines are bad. What makes them a 'game' is their unpredictability.

> "Airplane spoons carrying nutrients are good. What makes them a 'game' is the narrative/story."

While both are examples of gamification, neither has anything to do with game points, leaderboards, or progress indicators.

> "Good gamification is not just incorporating points, leaderboards, and badges onto your website, but it's creating a system to get people to care, to get people engaged. Sometimes that ends up giving them points. Sometimes it ends up being leaderboards or other things like that, but that's not what gamification really is."—[Yu-kai Chou](https://yukaichou.com/gamification-expert/), Actionable Gamification

Whether designing workout apps or online courses, gamification is often applied as an afterthought, like a cherry on top. That's a mistake.

`TODO: add what gamification really is.`

Gamification is the cream between the layers, not the cherry on top! 🍰

In **Beyond the Boring**, we'll explore student engagement in online courses and how we might implement gamification to create a positive learning experience that makes students excited about making progress.
